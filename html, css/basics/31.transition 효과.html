<!--
The code above is a CSS transition using media queries.
Its purpose is to make the image change size when the user hovers over it.

The order of properties after "transition: " is important.
The specific order is: property, duration, timing function, delay.

transition: width 2s linear 1s means that the width of the image will change from its original size to 300px in 2 seconds,
and then back to its original size in 1 second.
